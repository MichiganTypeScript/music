This was the first bit of music ever put together for MiTS.  It was done in quite a hurry: start-to-finish in about 30 minutes and before the thought arose to add the constraints of no samples or external plugins.  So it uses one sample (for the woosh sound) and Omnisphere.  Sorry if you don't have the plugin.  Although.  You should seriously give Omnisphere a look-see.
